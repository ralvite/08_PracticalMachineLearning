# Data preparation - variable selection

preprocessing steps for finding, removing, and cleaning data to prepare it for machine learning

* predictors with variance 0
* Exploratory data analysis: 1) multicollinearity, 2) outliers and missing values (common in sensor devices)
* transformation (preprocessing): dimension reduction (PCA) as predictors

# Model selection & stack

Find variable importance
Model assessment tools: RMSE, Accuracy, Confusion matrix
